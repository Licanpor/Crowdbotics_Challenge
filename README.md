# Crowdbotics Challenge

**In this project I worked on the Crowdbotics Frontend Engineering Challenge in wich I made an app using the iTunes API under the client and design requirements.**

**The projects was made with AngularJs, using trello to follow the process and Web Server for Chrome extension to set up a hosting.**

Here is a [link](https://trello.com/b/XpoVyR9h/crowdbotics-challenge) to the board on Trello where you could find my initial questions
and also the answer to the last one and a link to the gDoc document with the instructions to compare.


Any question or commentary, feel free to contact me.
